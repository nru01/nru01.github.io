			c-style language in the making
		</h1>
		<p>
			the idea is to make a language like c++ that removes the redundancy of
			placement of functions, or requiring two files for one class.
			also to make variable-type names, and casting simpler like it is in rust,
			while still maintaining the power that c provides.
